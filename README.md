# calculators
a repo for calculators written in different languages
js calculator, this is sort of fun but basic. It 
stings when it proves more complex, and I do 
not use tutorials. This is a proof of life for me,
I always hit a wall somewhere around making functions
and forcing types and stuff. Hopefully this progresses 
further than the last couple of tries.
